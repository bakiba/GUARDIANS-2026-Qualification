> Flag: ``

## DMZ30

> We can later see that there was a specific argument supplied to the installation command that launches the software automatically as Windows boots up, what was the argument? Accepted answer format is `--argument`.

> Flag: ``

## DMZ34
> Right after the software installation, the attacker set a backdoor password to the program. What was the password?
